<h2># SportsStore</h2>
<h3>The final Web App from Pro ASP.NET CORE MVC 2 Book from Adam Freeman</h3>

<p>My application, called SportsStore, will follow the classic approach taken by online stores everywhere.<br />I will create an online product catalog that customers can browse by category and page, a shopping cart<br />where users can add and remove products, and a checkout where customers can enter their shipping details.<br />I will also create an administration area that includes create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) facilities for<br />managing the catalog, and I will protect it so that only logged-in administrators can make changes.</p>

<h3>Getting started:</h3>
